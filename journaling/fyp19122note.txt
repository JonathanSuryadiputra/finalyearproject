things I can do to increase accuracy
- label datasets
- tune hyperparameters

Some things I found out
- naive bayes have no hyperparameters to tune as it is a simple algorithm (yet powerful when used with the right dataset). To increase accuracy data preprocessing is usually done (labelling data correctly, etc.) as well as feature selection.
- LSTM models have hyperparameters that you can tune

you can use these two models and approaches and strung them together in an ensemble of models.p
